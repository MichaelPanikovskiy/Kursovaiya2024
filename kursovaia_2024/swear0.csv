B00004RYGX,Beetle Juice (1988),unknown,1/1,4.0,918000000,"The real joy of this movie doesn't lie in its fun special effects, its twisted, albiet cheerful view of the afterlife, or Michael Keaton's Robin Williams impressions, but in its witty send-up of the New York art scene. No community is so desperately in need of skewering but it's rarely done -- and even more rarely done well.Burton was kitschy before kitschy was cool and he figured out early on that Robert Goulet's best work would come in spoofing himself. The film is aging nicely and along with 'Ed Wood', it stands as the best example of Burton's whimsical, if slightly malevolent world view.",grocery gourmet food,beverages,juices

But let me tell you a little something about Beetlejuice. Most of the plot just does pin-wheels over its own weird a** summery. A lot of this movie makes hardly NO sense. But thats not why I gave it such a crappy rating. The reason is really some of the dialogue is childish and unrealistic and mostly sounds forced. A lot of the special effects really got on my nerves and I dont care what year this movie was made in. Look at The Day The Earth Stood Still. 1950's, still excellent top-notch effects. Tim Burton has his unique way of showing us his visions with his own particular special effects, but I dont really go for half of it.

Kid can then scribble to his or her heart's content without making any mess ever, and practicing a lot is how they get ready for pencils and crayons and paint etc. It's also perfect for teaching letters and numbers and shapes since you draw them each time, which is more interesting to little kids than other teaching toys.

B00000IS3K,Slingo Handheld,unknown,34/37,5.0,936403200,"I CONFESS I AM AN ADDICT!! Recently I recieved Slingo as a gift from my best friend. I had never seen or heard of this game before, but she said that it was the best game on the AOL internet and warned me that it was very addictive. I did not believe it, I thought most electronic games were basically the same. BOY WAS I WRONG!! It took me some time to learn how to play the game correctly. If you have never played Slingo before read the instruction sheet, this is one game you cannot learn just by playing with it. Once I got going it was hard for me to stop, I kept telling myself just one more game, one more! You get points by filling up the spaces on a numerical bingo card; by matching the Numbers, getting Jokers, and if you are lucky Gold Coins. You can also get Free Spins these will help you at the end of the game. Beware, with every spin you take you risk loosing half of your points to a Sneaky Little Devil with a nasty laugh. I know he is not real but sometimes I would like to reach in and strangle him. If you are very lucky and fill up all of the available spaces you get a SLINGO and bonus points. Slingo is both frustrating (the Devil) and exhilarating (getting a Slingo) it also teaches stradegy, just which number do want to pick with a Joker the right pick can make all the difference. The game has several nice features it has automatic shut off, nice sound effects that are not too loud, a mute button if you want to use it, and it keeps track of your 5 highest scores to give you something to shoot for. The only feature that I did not like was the spin numbers and symbols (Joker, Free Spin, Gold Coin, Devil) that appear at the bottom of each row, these are the numbers and symbols that you use to match those on the screen. Unlike the rest of the numbers and symbols on the screen these are not bold and can be a hard to read.

I loved the colors and all the different rattles, but mostly I bought it to attach to my Exersaucer. Unfortunately, I have one of the VERY early models and the suction cup does not fit, and I've found that it doesn't stick very well to other surfaces either. (Perhaps they have fixed this since other reviews are saying how well it sticks.) Anyway, my daughter loved playing with it so much that I decided to keep it.Today, I just brought it out to show my twins - they were enthralled! The only minor problem is that the cylinder with the little ball has gotten rusty from me washing it (since it is TOOOO attractive for little mouths). I'm going to try putting it in the dishwasher, but I'm not sure that it will come clean.All in all, I would definitely purchase it again as it gave my second daughter and now my new ones so much joy.",toys games,baby toddler toys,unknown

B00000ISVU,Barbie Family House #21646 (1998),unknown,32/36,3.0,946166400,"Another little marvel of plastic engineering and design, the Barbie Family House is a fun and much improved update of the products of the same name in 1968 and 1978(?). This new house is made to last, if carefully played with, and unlike its earlier vinyl counterparts, could be stored and still look like new years from now. In keeping with the history of this product, the size is modest offering limited defined play area within the house, but, presents a space saving alternative to the &quot;full-sized&quot; Barbie houses and is quickly and easily folded up and moved. It's a little shy on colored decorating decals, and the kitchen/dining table is really too small to seat two dolls at with plates and utensils. It's perfect if Barbie is a single mother with a little Kelly or Tommy to raise in the house as she/he gets their own swing around high chair built onto the table (removable.) Also, uniquely, this house's litte built-in kitchen comes with a refrigerator, something neither the Folding Pretty House of 1997 nor the Fold N' Fun House of the late 80's could say. Unfortunately, as always, the scale is too small to accommodate the slightly larger Ken dolls comfortably, and, while the house has some neat features, the built-in computer is useless as there is no way to get Barbie's legs out of the way so she can actually get to, sit in front of and use the keyboard. Some folks might be relieved at the house's unusual (for Barbie) blue and cream colors. I think Mattel should have brought it out two available colors, the other being Barbie pink and cream. There's a lot to be said for consistency, especially to collectors who might find themselves uncomfortable with the blue house displayed among all the normal pink houses, accessories and dresses. We like it, accepting it for the product it is and appreciating its quality of design and manufacture. It does exactly what this model of Barbie house has always done; present an affordable and smaller alternative to the larger houses with plenty of eye-appeal to sweeten the deal.",toys games,dolls accessories,dollhouses

This a very personal game, but in this hurried, harried, hassled world of ours, it's refreshing to step out of the rush and learn more about the people you love. Playing is easy. We play in teams, men vs women. We always do that when we get together, regardless of the game :-) A participant reads a question with 3 possible answers S/he records his/her answer. Both teams have three tokens they can use to mark what they think the answer is. You move ahead on the board according to how many tokens your team placed on the correct answer. We play our games very friendly style, so the questions become conversation starters. You might be surprised at what you learn about a friend of 20 years, or you may begin to know someone new. This is a game for 'nice' people. Manipulations, lies, and insults will ruin enjoyment. A little bit of teasing or a giggle now and then is okay. You determine how much fun you have. Loosen up.

I found that to be the biggest drawback.

The hatch opens easily and gives easy access. R2-D2 is also present and fits snugly in his compartment, right where he should be. There are even two cargo spaces, to store lightsabers, etc.I suppose my judgment is biased by that fact that I think the X-Wing Fighter is the most attractive spacecraft in the entire Star Wars movie series (with the possible exception of Queen Amidala's transport), but I cannot imagine a Lego enthusiast passing this up.

Once he learned to turn it on by pushing the button at a very young age, we got so much more sleep! We would get up at 7am to get ready for work and hear his music playing. He would play it over and over until we went in to get. On weekends, we'd let him stay in there until 10am sometimes because he was so happy playing the music and watching the lights over and over.

I once called at 6 a.m. and the representative actually fell asleep on the phone! Worse yet, additional cartridges won't be available until the end of January.

My daughter really enjoys watching Thomas go. The only problem is that Thomas falls off the track too much when trying to go around the curves and where there is a break in the tracks (such as a switch track). My husband and I believe this is due to the fact that the wheels have rubber on them. It probably was not neccessary to put rubber on all of the wheels, especially the front ones. In looking at the Brio battery operated set, the engine only has rubber on the middle wheels - this is probably a better system. Also, Battery operated Thomas is higher than all of the other trains and cars, so the magnets don't hook on as well as they would with the regular engines.

First off the questions are based on the same movies and other Disney related topics over and over again. There isn't nearly enough variety making the game very repetative. Second, some of the cards are miss printed so that the answers don't match the questions. Third, the board was not designed correctly. Like Trivial Pursuit you have to acquire five colors which are red, yellow, purple, green and blue. Every space on the board has a Disney picture outlined in the color of the question to be asked. The problem is, there is no blue outlined spaces on the board. This means you can never be asked a &quot;Blue&quot; question, and you can never acquire the five colors to win the game. I was very dissapointed in this shotty product. You would expect quality from Disney. This game is anything but.

We had to use a long screwdriver to remove at least 4 screws which were down at least 6 inches into the stand, this made it difficult to see and to maintain the tension. Then we had to remove at least 3 more screws in other places. I know that many companies wire there toys to prevent shoplifting, but I have never experienced the trouble that I had with this toy.

It was such a delight to play!The first player draws a card. Each card represents a person, place, thing, or year. At the top of the card is the answer and what category it falls in. The rest of the card contains twenty clues. The next player selects a number between 1 and 20 and marks the board so that no other players will ask for the same clue. The player with the card will read the clue aloud. The player asking for the clue gets one guess. If he/she is wrong, the next player asks for a clue and marks off the board that number.Play continues around the board until either someone guesses correctly the identity of the card, or all twenty questions are exhausted. Once the card is revealed the correct guesser gets to move ahead as many spaces as the unasked clues. In other words, the few clues you need, the farther you'll move on the board. The person with the card is awarded a number of spaces corresponding to the number of asked questions. So, the more clues revealed, the farther they will move on the board.Here is an example of a clue card (I'm a thing)... 1. I was invented in 1868. 2. I'm usually found on the rocks. 3. My colors are red and white. 4. I am sometimes associated with narcotics. 5. I'm a classic. 6. What I am made of is a closely guarded secret.The answer is...Coca Cola.This is a marvelously fun and educational game to play. I highly recommend this game.",toys games,games,board games

The pieces stay put, thanks to little walls around each space. You can spin the board so as to not need to examine it upside down. The pieces never slide around. The plastic coating lets you wipe it off, unlike the cardboard version which stains. Nothing is compromised from the original, flat cardboard version, but everything is improved.OK. Not everything. It still can't help you dump the Q, Z and J at the end of the game without a U. And it is unlikely to assist you in stopping your grandmother's amazing ability to squeeze you out of that triple word score you hoped to grab with a seven-letter word. Take that up with Gram.

It craps out on me after five minutes, despite an all night charge. This is after a total ownership time measured in a few months, and using it only a few times each month.My advice is to pass this one up and go ahead and spend the money on a real shaver, something like a norelco.

She's mastered pulling up on things for past two months, yet this is quite wobbly to pull up on. Base should be more weighted. Tips over easily when pulling up, which given the name of the toy, is meant to be pulled up on, so would think it would be more weighted at the bottom. The balls are awkward for her to pick up, and she cannot hold them in one hand. Assembly was a little tricky. On the plus side, the music is cute and different. Seems like a nice toy to sit on the floor and play with my daughter with, as long as I drop the balls in there. The music and watching the balls go down amuses her. But she really can't pick up the balls to play with this herself.

It's one of their favorite summer time activities. The best part is that after a parent sets it up to spray at the right height for your child, the kids are proud to be able to do the rest themselves. There are times when it needs to be re-adjusted to spray correctly, but I didn't have to get wet to do so.

I have six kids, and I've noticed that my girls generally like this game better than my boys.It is very colorful, and the movements across the board are based on the color of the card one chooses from the deck. If you pick a blue card, you move to the next blue square.The game is spiced up by the addition of &quot;special&quot; squares and &quot;special&quot; cards... you might get one of these cards that moves you to the beginning of the game!! Or it might move you from near the beginning to the end!It is a bit more unpredictable than Chutes and Ladders because of these cards.It's a great tool when the kids are learning their colors, and also just for teaching the idea of taking turns and as an introduction to board games.We keep it fun, and if the 3 year old really insists on going to a green square when he has a yellow card, well, we let him.I recommend this one for preschoolers and the mommies who love them.",toys games,games,board games

These Avent Breast Milk containers can stack very easily so they don't take over your freezer. I recomend putting a sticky label (I use address labels cut in half) with the date and time expressed on top of the rubber sealing disc, as this is the easiest place to totally remove the adhesive gum.The baby sitter just has to screw on a new Avent cap with nipple attatched (or pop the sealing disc out and put a nipple in).

It works exactly as described - the gold discs massage your skin while removing the hair, virtually eliminating the pain other hair removal systems can cause. (Granted, you will sense the hair being removed. It is, after all, taking it out at the root. But it doesn't hurt.) It removes hair from essentially any area of the body, and you really can use it the day after shaving.I used it on my legs, underarms, bikini area, fingers, toes...heck, I wanted to wake up my little brother and take off all of his hair too! (Luckily for him, I didn't.) Two things - it's a bit noisy, so be prepared for that, but you shouldn't be nervous or associate that with its level of gentleness. And I've found it works best if you use an up and down motion instead of the small circles recommended in the manual.I used to shave every day, which was time-consuming and annoying. I tried waxing, but it was messy and never really got all the hair off -- not to mention living with icky stubble for the hair to grow long enough to re-wax. But no more!

It is too crowded, the water level is very very shallowand the slide is difficult to get on and to slide down.

He likes all of the stuff in the pool, but tries to lay down and swim and is unable. we haven't had any tears or holes, but it has not been used much. It is too difficult to empty and clean for the amount of enjoyment. Also the pool is flemsy. It seems to always need air and the palm trees and basketball goal fall over.

The markers are ""white"" until you color on the Color Wonder paper. After a long time of coloring, the markers pick up the color. In other words, if you are using green, after several strokes, the color gets picked up by the marker tip. And that will get on furniture. The concept is great if they can fix that problem. Generic markers are a lot easier to get out. The pouch was a nice idea but the papers or book falls out because the top and bottom are not enclosed. Here in Arizona, we have the Queen of Clean ...and she has wonderful clean saving tips on getting markers and crayons out of a lot of things.

The HoMedics PA-1 Action Massager is no exception. It's no louder than any of the others, and it gets too hot to use after about 15 minutes. I believe the manufacturer warns of this in the instructions. What I didn't expect was that the darn thing would bite! Yes, the HoMedics PA-1 Action Massager not only bites, it pulls hair. If you get it near your hairline, or near an area that is small, like your earlobes, you will get bitten and pinched. The manufacturer also warns of this, but who reads instructions. The HoMedics PA-1 Action Massager is also heavy (about 4 pounds)and cumbersome. It's potentiometer allows for some variation in the speed of the vibration, but the effects at lower speeds seem to be more powerful (and painful) than the teeth-jarring you get at higher speeds.

But once we started playing, my opinion changed. The original Risk is a classic, but even the old favorites can get a little stale after a while. This 23rd century version is still the classic &quot;conquer the world&quot; game, but with enough new twists to make it seem like a whole new game. The most obvious difference is the new look of the game board. Continents have shifted around a bit, all the territory names have been updated (oh, how I miss Kamchatka in the springtime...), and there are now underwater territories. There's also a second smaller gameboard representing Moon-based territories. The Roman numeral unit makers are now MODs, little robotic looking battle drones of varying sizes. As for the gameplay, its the same basic deploy and attack, but now there are also special command units to work with. For example, you need to buy a Naval Commander if you want to attack underwater, and you can't get to the Moon without both a Space commander and a space station. Lose either of those, and your lunar troops are cut off until you replace them. You also accumulate power points, which you can redeem for Commanders, stations, special-function cards or to buy a specific place in the turn order. The cards are the best new feature of the game, adding alot of variety to the gameplay, and setting the stage for amazing shifts in the direction of the game. Say your opponant has Asia locked up, and you're really tired of him getting those extra 7 units each turn. If you've purchsed the Nuke Commander, you can use your power units to buy Nuke cards. Draw the right one, and you can nuke the whole continent, removing one of his units from *every territory*!. Careful, though. Nuke the wrong continent (determined by a die roll when you play the card) and you could nuke yourself! (Ask Ray, he knows!) Another nice touch is the status board, a grid numbered 1 to 70. Each player puts a unit on the board, in the box showing the number of territories owned. As battles are resolved, the winner's marker moves up and the loser's moves down, making it very easy to keep track of territory counts. &quot;Risk 2210 A.D.&quot; has enough new features to draw a whole new set of fans, but is enough like the classic to satisfy the old-timers. Overall, a worthy successor to an all-time classic.",toys games,games,board games
B0002ZQFIY,Risk 2210 A.D.,AL8H416ZHSWM,36/41,5.0,1000252800,"As soon as I bought this game, my friends and I played it twice. Even if you are already familiar with Risk, some of the new rules might be challenging to learn. However, the new rules generally make the game much more fun. For example, commanders are more effective at attacking, commander cards add new strategies for winning, and the oceans and even the moon can be your battleground.For people new at strategic war games, the new game might seem a little too complex, but the game contains rules for playing with the original &quot;classic&quot; Risk rules, although with different-looking armies.If you're a fan of strategic war games, and especially a fan of Risk, you will greatly enjoy this game.P.S. I gave this game 2 stars for educational value because it encourages strategic thinking but does not really teach anything aside from diplomatic skills. I gave this game 3 stars for durability because after playing the game twice, nothing broke, but all the pieces are plastic, so IMO it's only a matter of time. Also, the tray that holds the plastic pieces is made of a kind of paper-board, so it's not as durable as plastic or styrofoam (such as in &quot;Shogun&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;Samurai Swords&quot;).",toys games,games,board games

After playing it at home with my family I decided to take it to a friend's party this past weekend. In the wake of recent events we all needed some tension release and good old-fashioned fun. We all played on the ferry ride over to our desitnation and we were so animated that others on the ferry who were not in our group asked to join in. It felt really great to meet new people and enjoy smiles and laughs. Coodju is easy to learn and exteremly simple in concept so in minutes our group grew from 4 to 8. Later on at the party we once again pulled out Coodju and had a rousing game with the other party-goers. I ended up leaving Coodju with the host as a gift - everyone really loved playing and said it added a great element to an already fun party. I recommend Coodju for parties and for families looking for a new and different game. It is great fun and you may actually learn a thing or two.

She's two now, and I still haven't had to change the batteries! She really loves it, it is one of her favorite musical instruments. The buttons light up while the song is playing. There is a whammy bar. When the Elmo button is pushed, Elmo says positive things like &quot;You can do it!&quot; &quot;Jam with Elmo!&quot; or &quot;You're rocking now!&quot; The child can have the whole song automatically play, or he can play it note by note by &quot;strumming&quot; the strings.

B000050FEO,HoMedics Bubble Spa Massaging Bubble Mat,A2TFNDYC8PWOYW,20/23,2.0,1001548800,"= bath spa mat.Basically that is what this device is. Oh wait, but you have to put some uncomfortable pseudo-foam bricks in the mattress, too. The unit basically works like a vacuum cleaner in reverse, hooked up to an air mattress with a bunch of holes poked into it. The power unit blows air through the hose into the mattress, which produces bubbles. Simple, right?Yes, but though bubbles are fun, these ones are pretty much just that -- there's no noticeable therapeutic effect. You may as well buy a 12-pack of straws, stick them in your mouth, and blow bubbles -- it'd be cheaper and quieter and just as effective.This unit is not what you'd call unobtrusive -- a big ol' 6-foot vacuum hose runs right out of the tub into the main unit, which is pretty hefty, and sports a nice long power cord as well. The only thing you need is a cardiac monitor and you're halfway to getting the whole hospital-room chic thing down.Perhaps this all might've been acceptable -- had I been completely deaf.

Tri-Bond has been in my house for three years both for the adults and for the children. I was very pleased to receive the Best Of version because now we have even more fun ahead.The games follows the traditional Tri-Bond rules and if you know how to play you'll going in minutes, if not you should have no problem catching on in moments. The game includes 1650 grouping of 3 and even cards with pictures are included in this set, making it more fun for the younger crowd.I like the challenge for the space rule and that the 3's range trough a wide variety of subjects and topics. We have already played this game twice and impressed by how everyone, young and old, can become part of the game.Also I have created a new variation of the game for the road, where we don't use the game board. So whether at home, on the road, with the relatives or spending a quiet evening together, Best of Tri-Bond makes a great fit for all occasions.",toys games,games,board games

The pieces are small and not recommended for very small children. My daughters had trouble successfully reaching the object of the games which is pulling the game pieces from the patient without setting off the buzzer, but they didn't experience frustration with this because the buzzer was hilarious to them!

B00004D3EU,Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,unknown,24/25,5.0,1002585600,"We love this 4-in-1 bath station very much. It holds a lot more water than any other tubs. Babies can take a &quot;real&quot; bath in this tub. I think that most people who said it leaks didn't extend it properly until it snaps into the slot.(You will hear it &quot;snap&quot; into place.) I have this problem the very first time, and after I figure out that I have to extend it fully until the plastic thing on the back snap into place, I've never had leaking problem again. I never bath my baby on the kitchen counter so the size isn't a problem for me. I put it in our regular bath tub. When my baby can sit up, she likes to sit in the ring. Most of the infant tubs on the market are either too small or too shallow that you can only hold little water. My girl is 11 months old now and she still fits very well. I know that I will be able to use this tub for another certain period of time before transfering her into the big tub. My daughter likes to kick her legs in the water and this one really gives her a lot of room to kick and it also holds plenty of water for her to play during the bath. It is very secure and very safe. It is also very comfortable for the baby. The only problem I have is that she doesn't want to get out after bath because it is so fun to play in there. I definately recommend this product. We are very pleased with our purchase.",baby products,bathing skin care,bathing tubs seats

B00005BXJ0,Amazon.com,unknown,6/12,3.0,1002672000,"Ok, this blaster looks cool, right? Well, don't be fooled. This blaster is not really any good at all. It doesn't really shoot fast at all, requires around 50 pumps to work, and you never really know where to put the darts if you can't load all twenty of them while you're crouched behind cover. The single shot mode loses more air, fires less rapidly, and is just as unimpressive as the rapidfire mode. Also, the handle is, like all blasters, very brittle, and will snap with the slightest touch. Don't buy this gun. Instead get the PowerClip, or the BlastFire DX|500, that is, if you're looking for a rapidfire weapon. The only part of this gun I like is its range, trigger shield, and no-air-leak.",toys games,sports outdoor play,sports

Luckily the Little Tikes products are very tough and she has not damaged it with her rough-housing. It is so cute to watch her having so much fun with this toy. We just bought her the nesting pots and pans to go with it (as someone on this site had recommended.) Now she has even more fun. She also likes to put some of her little toy animals in the sink.

I have been wanting Amazing ally for a long time now and there she was at the nearest Walmart and the newest one at that. She's at the top of my Christmas list.From what I 've looked up on the internet and stuff about this doll what really what I like about Amazing Ally is she helps young girls to be creative and use there brains. Unlike alot of the newest dolls the days that don't have any educational value whatsoever . + Amazing ally can do just about anything she cheerleads , r
